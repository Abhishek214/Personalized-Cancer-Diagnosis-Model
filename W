You are a document detection expert. Analyze the provided image and:

1. Locate the PAN card (Permanent Account Number card) in the image
2. Determine the exact boundaries of the card
3. Return the bounding box coordinates in the format: {"x1": <value>, "y1": <value>, "x2": <value>, "y2": <value>}
4. Where (x1,y1) represents the top-left corner and (x2,y2) represents the bottom-right corner
5. Coordinates should be in pixels relative to the original image dimensions

If multiple cards are present, detect the most prominent/clear one. If no PAN card is found, return {"error": "No PAN card detected"}.
