IMAGE ANALYSIS TASK - COORDINATE DETECTION

Image dimensions: {img.size[0]} pixels wide Ã— {img.size[1]} pixels tall

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Scan the ENTIRE image systematically from left to right, top to bottom
2. Look for the rectangular Hong Kong ID card containing a person's photo and text
3. The card has these visual elements: person's photo on right side, Chinese/English text, official formatting
4. Identify the exact pixel boundaries where the card edges are located

COORDINATE REQUIREMENTS:
- Return EXACT pixel coordinates as integers
- x1,y1 = top-left corner of the card
- x2,y2 = bottom-right corner of the card  
- All values must be between 0 and image dimensions
- Double-check coordinates before responding

RESPONSE FORMAT (exact JSON):
{{"x1": <integer>, "y1": <integer>, "x2": <integer>, "y2": <integer>}}

CRITICAL: The card is a rectangular document with clear edges. Find the precise pixel boundaries where the document starts and ends.
